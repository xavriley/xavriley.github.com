					<p>Whilst I don't do so much PHP development nowdays, I've been watching <br />
the current rennaissance with interest. PHP is taking note of trends <br />
being pushed by the Rails world with "clean and classy" frameworks such <br />
as <a href="http://laravel.com/">Laravel</a> and best practice manifestos like <a href="http://www.phptherightway.com/">PHP the right <br />
way</a> coming to light. This is all good <br />
news for the web because better quality code (whatever language it's <br />
written in) raises the bar all round. </p>

<p>That said, there still seems to be a lack of good documentation <br />
concerning proper Behaviour Driven Development (BDD) with PHP and it's a <br />
problem that we came across recently at <a href="http://kyan.com">Kyan</a>. I'm going to try and do a <br />
walkthrough of setting up some simple fetaure testing using a default <br />
install of the <a href="http://www.prestashop.com">Prestashop</a> ecommerce <br />
framework. It's a fairly sizeable project that doesn't ship with test <br />
coverage - let's fix that!</p>

<h2 id="whatyoullneed">What you'll need</h2>

<ul>
<li>A local install of <a href="http://www.prestashop.com">Prestashop</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Firefox</a> (just the standard consumer version, not Aurora or nightly)</li>
<li><a href="http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar">Selenium RC (2.25.0 at the time of writing)</a></li>
<li><p>PHP 5.4 (just so we're all on the same page)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://behat.org/">Behat (a PHP testing framework)</a> </p></li>
<li><a href="http://mink.behat.org/">Mink (web acceptance testing for Behat)</a> </li>
<li><a href="http://getcomposer.org/">Composer (a PHP packaging tool - think Bundler for PHP)</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="1installprestashop">1.) Install Prestashop</h3>

<p>Prestashop has a good set of instructions so I won't duplicate them all <br />
here. Suffice to say you need to set up a MySQL db and change a few <br />
permissions.</p>

<h3 id="2installcomposer">2.) Install Composer</h3>

<p>Make sure PHP is in your path. You can test this by firing up terminal <br />
and typing</p>

<pre><code class="bash">php -v  
</code></pre>

<p>If you're using MAMP, put something like <br />
this at the bottom of your <code>.bashrc</code></p>

<pre><code class="bash">export PATH="/Applications/MAMP/bin/:$PATH"  
</code></pre>

<p>Double check the path to the MAMP binaries. It's different in different <br />
versions of MAMP.</p>

<p>Now <code>cd</code> into your newly created prestashop folder and run the following <br />
commands to install composer;</p>

<pre><code>mkdir bin  
curl -s https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=bin  
</code></pre>

<p>If you're installing using the default OSX apache and you get an error <br />
about "detect_unicode = Off", you'll also need to <br />
run the following;</p>

<pre><code>sudo su  
echo "detect_unicode = Off" &gt;&gt; /private/etc/php.ini  
apachectl restart  
exit  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="3installbehatandmink">3.) Install Behat and Mink</h3>

<p>This part is the reason I'm writing this blog post. There seems to be a <br />
lack of clear information about how to get these up and running from <br />
scratch. Hopefully this will be sorted out as time goes on but I would <br />
suggest people submit their points about what works and doesn't work for <br />
them.</p>

<p>To get started, make a file called <code>composer.json</code> in the root of the <br />
Prestashop install and put in the following;</p>

<pre><code class="json">{
    "require": {
        "behat/behat":           "2.4@stable",
        "behat/mink-extension":  "*",
        "behat/mink-goutte-driver":     "*",
        "behat/mink-selenium2-driver":  "*"
    },
    "minimum-stability": "dev",
    "config": {
        "bin-dir": "bin"
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This is the equivalent of a Gemfile if you've used bundler and Ruby. So <br />
to get everything up and running, run composer like so.</p>

<pre><code>php bin/composer.phar install  
</code></pre>

<p>All being, well you should see the packages installing into a vendor <br />
folder in the project root.</p>

<h3 id="4settingupbehat">4.) Setting up Behat</h3>

<pre><code class="bash">&gt; bin/behat --init                     
+d features - place your *.feature files here
+d features/bootstrap - place bootstrap scripts and static files here
+f features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php - place your feature related code here
</code></pre>

<p>This bootstraps the files needed to run the tests. Let's go ahead and <br />
write our first test. Usually in test driven development, we write the <br />
tests before the code, but I'm advocating here that we can add tests to <br />
and exisiting site to give us the confidence to refactor and add <br />
features later on. Start editing /features/basket.feature and put in <br />
the following;</p>

<pre><code class="gherkin">Feature: Basket  
  In order to add a product to the basket
  As a website user
  I need to add the product to my basket
  And I should see the product in the basket 

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a product to basket
    Given I am on a product page
    When I click "Add to cart"
    And I hover over "#shopping_cart a"
    Then I should see the product title 
</code></pre>

<p>This is an example of a Cucumber test (the natural language syntax is <br />
referred to as Gherkin) which is a popular way of doing acceptance <br />
testing in Rails and other frameworks. We proceed by running the test <br />
like so;</p>

<pre><code class="bash">&gt; bin/behat
Feature: Basket  
  In order to add a product to the basket
  As a website user
  I need to add the product to my basket
  And I should see the product in the basket

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a product to basket     # features/basket.feature:8
    Given I am on a product page
    When I click on "Add to cart"
    And I hover over "#shopping_cart a"
    Then I should see the product title

1 scenario (1 undefined)  
4 steps (4 undefined)  
0m0.039s

You can implement step definitions for undefined steps with these snippets:

    /**
     * @Given /^I am on a product page$/
     */
    public function iAmOnAProductPage()
    {
        throw new PendingException();
    }

    /**
     * @When /^I click "([^"]*)"$/
     */
    public function iClick($arg1)
    {
        throw new PendingException();
    }

    /**
     * @Given /^I hover over "([^"]*)"$/
     */
    public function iHoverOver($arg1)
    {
        throw new PendingException();
    }

    /**
     * @Then /^I should see the product title$/
     */
    public function iShouldSeeTheProductTitle()
    {
        throw new PendingException();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>This runs the test and tells you what to do next. Copy the snippets into <br />
the <code>features/bootstrap/FeatureContext.php</code> file above the final <br />
curly brace. After saving and running <code>bin/behat</code> again, the output should change to include </p>

<pre><code>TODO: write pending definition  
</code></pre>

<h3 id="5enablemink">5.) Enable Mink</h3>

<p>This is where the documentation starts to part ways with the latest <br />
versions of Mink and Behat. After struggling with the official run <br />
through at <a href="http://mink.behat.org/">http://mink.behat.org/</a> trying to <br />
get Zombie working as the Javascript client, I stumbled across the Mink <br />
example repository in the Behat official Github page here <br />
<a href="https://github.com/Behat/MinkExtension-example">https://github.com/Behat/MinkExtension-example</a></p>

<p>The key is swapping out <code>BehatContext</code> in the <code>FeaturesContext</code> file, to <br />
make sure that it reads;</p>

<pre><code class="php">class FeatureContext extends Behat\MinkExtension\Context\MinkContext  
</code></pre>

<p>and then you need to configure Behat and Mink to be looking in the right <br />
places and choosing the correct browser drivers. Make a file called <br />
<code>behat.yml</code> in the root of the project with the following;</p>

<pre><code class="yaml">default:  
  context:
    class:  'FeatureContext'
  extensions:
    Behat\MinkExtension\Extension:
      base_url:  'http://tdd.prestashopexample.com/'
      goutte:    ~
      selenium2: ~
</code></pre>

<p><code>goutte</code> seems to be a requirement as far as I can tell, but who
knows...</p>

<p>Now when you run <code>bin/behat</code> again, you should see an error like this;</p>

<pre><code>Curl error thrown for http POST to http://localhost:4444/wd/hub/session with params: {"desiredCapabilities":{"browserName":"firefox","version":"8","platform":"ANY","browserVersion":"8","browser":"firefox"},"requiredCapabilities":[]}  
</code></pre>

<p>Enter Selenium...</p>

<h3 id="6settingupselenium">6.) Setting up selenium</h3>

<p>This should be quite straightforward. First off, make sure you have the <br />
standard version of Firefox installed. Download Selenium RC from the link <br />
at the top of the page and move the <code>.jar</code> file to the <code>vendor/</code> folder. <br />
Then run the following command to start the Selenium server;</p>

<pre><code>java -jar vendor/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar &gt; /dev/null &amp;  
</code></pre>

<p>You should see <code>INFO: Launching a standalone server</code> and you're good to <br />
try the tests again by running <code>bin/behat</code>. This time you'll see Firefox <br />
start up, flash up with the page content and close again. The first test <br />
passed! Now let's implement the others.</p>

<h3 id="7finishingthesteps">7.) Finishing the steps</h3>

<p>Change the methods in <code>FeatureContext.php</code> to look like this;</p>

<pre><code class="php">    /**
     * @Given /^I hover over "([^"]*)"$/
     */
    public function iHoverOver($arg1)
    {
        $this-&gt;getSession()-&gt;getPage()-&gt;find('css', $arg1)-&gt;mouseOver();
        $this-&gt;getSession()-&gt;wait(5000, "$('#cart_block_list').hasClass('expanded')");
    }

    /**
     * @Then /^I should see the product title$/
     */
    public function iShouldSeeTheProductTitle()
    {
        $product_title = $this-&gt;getSession()-&gt;getPage()-&gt;find('css', '.cart_block_product_name');
        $product_title == "iPod Nano";
    }
</code></pre>

<p>A few things to note here before we proceed - this isn't a very robust <br />
test and could be improved. There's duplication all over the place which <br />
could be refactored (but it's late and I've just got it working...). The <br />
real problem is that it's assuming the title of the product as the <br />
assertion in the last point. A better approch would be to call/mock the <br />
product from Prestashop in the constructor and use that instead. Maybe <br />
in part 2.</p>

<p>Also, it bugged me that the <code>wait-&gt;(...)</code> call which executes JS is <br />
executed in the context of the session. It makes perfect sense in <br />
hindsight as <code>getPage</code> is returning a sort of DOM object but it tripped <br />
me up nonetheless.</p>

<p>Down to business - run <code>bin/behat</code> one last time and the output should <br />
look like this;</p>

<pre><code class="bash">&gt; bin/behat                                                                                       1 ↵
Feature: Basket  
  In order to add a product to the basket
  As a website user
  I need to add the product to my basket
  And I should see the product in the basket

  @javascript
  Scenario: Add a product to basket     # features/basket.feature:8
    Given I am on a product page        # FeatureContext::iAmOnAProductPage()
    When I click on "Add to cart"       # FeatureContext::iClickOn()
    And I hover over "#shopping_cart a" # FeatureContext::iHoverOver()
    Then I should see the product title # FeatureContext::iShouldSeeTheProductTitle()

1 scenario (1 passed)  
4 steps (4 passed)  
0m4.056s  
</code></pre>

<p>Happy days!</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There's a ton of PHP apps out there that would benefit from regression <br />
tests like this. They're not that hard to write once you get going and <br />
they give you an invaluable safety net and peace of mind when it comes <br />
to refactoring and adding new features. </p>

<p>My motivation for writing this was that the current state of documentation <br />
seems a bit patchy, despite the Behat and Mink projects being well established. <br />
I suppose this is a call to arms to PHP devs to try this stuff out <br />
and get their feedback into the loop. </p>

<p>I'd love to see more advanced posts dealing with the various drivers <br />
that are available and also to hear what people think of <br />
this one. I'll finish by saying I'm starting out on this trail so my advice <br />
is only what I've managed to cobble together up to now. If there's <br />
improvements or suggestions in the comments I'll happily fold them back in to <br />
the main post. Happy testing...</p>
