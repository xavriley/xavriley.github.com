#Test driving Prestashop with Behat, Mink and Selenium

Whilst I don't do so much PHP development nowdays, I've been watching
the current rennaissance with interest. PHP is taking note of trends
being pushed by the Rails world with "clean and classy" frameworks such
as [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) and best practice manifestos like [PHP the right
way](http://www.phptherightway.com/) springing up in the past couple of
years. This is all good news for the web because better quality code (whatever 
language it's written in) breeds higher expectations of what's possible. 

That said, there still seems to be a lack of good documentation
concerning proper behaviour driven development with PHP and it's a
problem that we came across recently at Kyan. I'm going to try and do a
walkthrough of setting up some simple fetaure testing using a default
install of the [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com) ecommerce
framework. It's a fairly sizeable project that doesn't ship with test
coverage - let's fix that!

## What you'll need

- A local install of [Prestashop](http://www.prestashop.com) (duh...)
- Firefox (just the standard consumer version, not Aurora or nightly)
- [Selenium RC (2.25.0 at the time of writing)](http://selenium.googlecode.com/files/selenium-server-standalone-2.25.0.jar)
- PHP 5.4 (just so we're all on the same page)

- [Behat (a testing framework)](http://behat.org/) 
- [Mink (web acceptance testing)](http://mink.behat.org/) 
- Composer (a PHP packaging tool - think Bundler if you've used that
  before)
