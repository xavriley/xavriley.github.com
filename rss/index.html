To save my wife from hearing me talk about programming and tax law I'm making like it's 2004 and (re)starting a blog. Properly this time. Like with actual content and everything.</p>

<h3 id="discoveringghost">Discovering Ghost</h3>

<p>For past blogging attempts I've used Wordpress (easy) and Jekyll (hackable) and neither were much fun. As a developer I want something that's easy <em>and</em> hackable and I'm hoping that the node based Ghost fits the bill.</p>

<p>I get to write Markdown (win) with a nice javascript-based preview window, and the posts save to an SQLite database. </p>

<h4 id="installation">Installation</h4>

<pre><code>wget https://ghost.org/zip/ghost-0.4.1.zip
unzip ghost-0.4.1.zip
cd ghost-0.4.1
brew update
brew install node
npm install --production
npm start
</code></pre>

<p>Very nice!</p>

<h4 id="hosting">Hosting</h4>

<p>I'd been hosting up to now on Github pages which to be honest has been a giant PITA (mainly because of issues with Octopress). I'm looking at moving to Heroku but in the interests of getting up and running quickly, I used <a href='https://github.com/axitkhurana/buster' >buster</a> to generate a static site from my local Ghost install.</p>

<pre><code>sudo pip install buster
buster setup --gh-repo=git@github.com:xavriley/xavriley.github.com.git
buster generate --domain=http://localhost:2368
buster preview # browse localhost:9000 to check
buster add-domain xavierriley.co.uk
buster deploy
</code></pre>

<p>Except in my case <code>buster deploy</code> failed because of my existing Octopress blog in that repo. After taking a fresh clone to backup the old blog, I deployed by:</p>

<pre><code>cd  static # where buster makes it's repo
git push -f origin master
</code></pre>

<p>which <em>blows away the old repo</em> and lets me deploy normally from then on.</p>

<h5 id="forbonuspoints">For bonus points</h5>

<p>To make the deploy process smoother, try running:</p>

<pre><code>sudo sh -c 'echo "127.0.0.1 local.tryghost.org" &gt;&gt; /etc/hosts'
</code></pre>

<p>to be able to run <code>buster generate</code> with no extra args.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>From discovering Ghost to deploying to Github pages took about 15 minutes and I didn't have any issue that held me up for more than about 10 seconds. Now I've been programming professionally for the last six years and I can honestly say <a href='http://joearms.github.io/2014/02/07/why-programming-is-difficult.html' >that doesn't happen very often</a>.</p>]]></description><link>http://my-ghost-blog.com/blogging-with-ghost-buster-and-github-pages/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">e4bf4dbf-a9c8-4452-9e33-f20d07c94a47</guid><category><![CDATA[Getting Started]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Xavier Riley]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 01 Mar 2014 14:15:32 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
